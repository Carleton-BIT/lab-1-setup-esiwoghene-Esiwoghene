**Note:** You must edit your code using VSCode, and perform actions in git using the git command line interface (as discussed in class!)

In this lab, you will do some simple HTML edits and commit your changes using the git CLI. These are the steps you must follow:

## Setup

### Run these commands so that git is configured correctly

`git config --global core.editor "nano"`

`git config --global user.name "Your Name"` <--replace `Your Name` with your name

`git config --global user.email "you@example.com"` <-- Replace `you@example.com` with your carleton email

### Create a folder on your computer for this repository
   
### Right click to open a terminal in that folder. Then use the `git clone` command to clone this repository
   
### Open VSCode and install the Live Preview extension
   
### Open the folder containing your repository in VSCode

### Change the title of the webpage to "Lab 1",  verify it works using the Live Preview, and save your change

### Run the following commands:

`git add .`

`git commit -m "change webpage title`

`git push origin main`

Note that your terminal needs to be open in the folder of your github repository for this to work

### Verify your changes are pushed to your repository by viewing it on the GitHub website
